# Fitness Tracker

## Introduction

This Application is meant for people who wish to track their weekly fitness goals, and see how much work they have been putting in. The Application is able to get and track your workouts and give you weekly data tailored from your workouts to give information such as weight for the week, exercises performed and Which days these were performed.

## Description

This application was built using mongodb along with mongoose to run the connection to the databse. It also uses REST api functionality to connect the server with the database and serve the user their desired data. All backend code was hand written by myself while front end functionality belongs to trilogy education services.

## Installation

To run this application, you will need to download the files from github in order to have the base application. From there, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where these files are located and run an `npm i` to install necessary json packages for full functionality of the application. Once that is complete, to run it on your local machine, type the command `node server.js` and visit the localhost to see the application.
